### Problem
Given the amount of security breaches and website hacks that have occurred in the recent past, it is difficult for people to know and track where a given set of login credentials have been exposed to these security breaches in order for you to go through and change login information for each affected site and corresponding set of compromised login credentials.

### Solution
We built Compro, a site that allows users to input an email address and receive back a list of sites where you are vulnerable.  Using this information, a user can systematically go through and resolve these issues by changing their account for each of the affected sites.
